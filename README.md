# Time Series Neural Networks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sofienealouini/tsnn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sofienealouini/tsnn) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sofienealouini/tsnn/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/sofienealouini/tsnn?branch=master)



TSNN is a deep learning library for time series forecasting built on Keras/Tensorflow. It implements various RNN-based models from recent research papers.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Conda will set up a virtual environment with the exact version of Python used for development along with all the dependencies needed to run TSNN.

```
conda create -n tsnn python=3.6
source activate tsnn
```

### Installing

Once you have activated your conda environment, you can easily install the package and all its dependencies from PyPI.

```
pip install tsnn
```

The next section provides a quick start guide to using TSNN. A more comprehensive tutorial is detailed in the PackageTesting.ipynb notebook.

## Using TSNN




## Built With

* [Keras](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - High level Deep Learning library running on top of Tensorflow / Theano / CNTK
* [Tensorflow](https://maven.apache.org/) - Library for numerical computation, chosen as  Keras backend in TSNN.
